This file is a result from the Quick Debug setting.  The values for each iteration represent the decimal version of the check node satisifed booleans.
In other words, the check nodes are checked for their satisfying parity conditions and the binary results from all the checknodes are combined into a single decimal number.
In order to verify the accuracy of this LDPC you will need to compare the below values with that of the Floating Point version or another previously verified LDPC
